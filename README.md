## About this Repo <a name="About"></a>
This repository holds our official list of DDK examples code. They aim to showcase the different ways you can leverage the DDK to help with your DataOps workloads, including building a data pipeline to ingest SaaS data or to create your private code artifactory, for example.

We welcome contributions to this repository in the form of enhancements to existing examples or the addition of new ones. For more information on contributing, please see the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-ddk-examples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

It is assumed that you are already somewhat familiar with the AWS DDK. If not, we strongly recommend that you go through our [Learning Resources](#Learning) first, in particular the DDK workshop and documentation.

If you would like to start your journey by looking at an example, we recommend you to start with [Basic Data Pipeline](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-ddk-examples/tree/main/basic-data-pipeline) example from the list below.
